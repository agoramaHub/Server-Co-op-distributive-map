# Server Co-op distributive map, API and frontend

This repo holds the basic API used to add nodes to the distributive map (frontend display).
Currently in very basic form... However, if you are interested in how it works and whats
happening under the hood, you can read the the comments directly in the source code.

Please note this API uses MongoDB for its database - so you must have an instance installed locally
or have a remote cloud account with another service that can provided you with a MongoDB to
connect with.
